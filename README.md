This package is a combination of things that I find useful to have, borne out of copying a function or two here and there from one project to another. It's still a work in progress, but I will continue to add to it as I can and need, please feel free to suggest additions that you would like to see.

The package is broken up into a series of classes that are targeted towards being a group of related functions. Currently there are:
1. API - for things useful when working with APIs, like encoding JSON to URL encoded
2. Colours - converting hex, rgb, hsl, and generating shades of a colour (via hsl)
3. d3 - a big TODO pile, meant to be to do a few repetative taskss like generating bar chart etc
4. DOM - manipulation of the DOM
5. Financial - working out compound interest, loan payments, etc
6. Functions (fn) - handy things like to run a function once only and not permit again
7. Logging - a basic log messages with timestamp to a file
8. Maths - sums, averages, degrees and radians, rands that kinda thing
9. Node - things that can be handy working in node.js
10. Other - things that haven't found their own class yet (deep copy, equality check of objects and arrays, copy to clipboard from DOM)
11. Sort - the beginnings of different sort algorithms
12. Stats - mean, median, mode, standard deviation
13. Strings - change case (title, camel, pascal), truncate sentences to a limit with or without ellipsis
14. SVG - create arcs and wedges with polar coords
15. Time - add and subtract days from a date, calculate time between dates, days in a month, long day or month name
